    This is a demo API that allows you to interact with the Open Finance and Leafy Bank systems.

    ** Goal **: Showcase where MongoDB shines as part of an Open Finance Architecture.

    MongoDB excels in its flexibility, serving as a central data storage solution for retrieving data
    from external financial institutions while seamlessly supporting diverse formats and structures.

    ## Quick Start

    1. Get Token: Use the `/get_authorization` public endpoint to get a Bearer token.
        - E.g. **user_identifier:** `fridaklo`
    2. Authorization: ** Introduce the Bearer token value in the `Authorize` button on the top right corner.
    3. Explore: Access the secure endpoints for Open Finance and Leafy Bank.

    ## Documentation

    Visit `/docs` or `/redoc` for interactive API documentation.

    ** This API leverages MongoDB to accommodate the dynamic needs of modern financial data management. **
